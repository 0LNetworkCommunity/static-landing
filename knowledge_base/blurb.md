# Open Libra Shareable Blurb

Open Libra forked from Facebook's Libra/Diem project the day it launched. It became the first public Move language blockchain, preceding Aptos and Sui by years. After many experiments and battle testing, OL is now mature.

Different from other Layer-1 narratives, this project is a straight shot to the end state of blockchains: a sovereign wealth fund.

The protocol operates as a perpetual endowment. It uses specialized sub-endowments to allocate capital for automation opportunities (not exclusive to blockchain).

Open Libra is led by crypto OGs, distinguished engineers, and CS/economics professors from top programs. The project features innovations in economics and mechanism design:
- Lowest-cost competitive BFT consensus ("Proof of Fee")
- Decades-long vesting for founders ("Slow Wallets")
- Open endowment creation ("Community Wallets")
- Matching contributions ("Match Index")
- Anti-bot verification ("Vouch Score")

This is back-to-basics crypto with an extremely long time horizon. No ICO, venture capital, or centralized company; only mined tokens. To be disbursed over a century, endowment capital represents 85% of total supply, with much going to recognized nonprofits and public interest funding.

Recently upgraded to V8 and preparing for wide-scale go-to-market.
