1. Yes, We Took It
-----------------------------------------------------

Many years ago we hard-forked FacebookÂ¹ out of DiemÂ².

2. To Fulfill the Promise of Good Capital
-----------------------------------------------------

We were attracted to blockchain for a promise of independent capital which would make the future arrive faster.

Crypto currencies are silly. Worse, crypto now belongs to banks, ETFs, and hedge funds. And the technology itself is in the rear-view mirror.

We think open, perpetually durable, hyper-liquid, high-leverage, rent producing titles are a gift to society, if they are designed that way.


3. By Producing a Sensible Asset
-----------------------------------------------------

$CARPE is an accessible and perpetual digital property. It is carefully designed for its purpose: capital.

Prosperity comes from people saving and planning for transformation.

Over the years our peer-to-peer games have made users save, pledge, defer, or donate nearly 90%+ of their earnings to future programs, for good and profit.

4. Which is Fiercely Independent
-----------------------------------------------------

We make correct choices because we don't owe anything to anyone.

*Government proof*
Every coin was mined and no money ever raised.

*No legal entity*
Yes to moral authority and meritocracy.

*No ponzinomics*
Let's play games the world wants to play.

*Standalone tech*
We don't be hostage to political economy of a host chain.

*No thanks VCs*
We have no rush, and infinite possibilities.

5. Uses Modern Tools
-----------------------------------------------------

Having our own Layer-1 blockchain ensures $CARPE's independence.

We've been developing and running high performance Diem and Move blockchains platforms since 2019. The chain is meant to have all the smart contracts any person or institution would need to use, save, plan with $CARPE. It actively excludes any nonsense to distract us. Think $CARPE, not Blockchain.

6. And Has Plans Measured in Centuries
-----------------------------------------------------

We play a long game that few have patience for.

On the other side of the desert exists dependable capital for interventions in society, for all future generations.
