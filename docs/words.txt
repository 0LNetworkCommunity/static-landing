1. Yes, We Took It
We hard-forked Facebook¹ out of Libra.

2. To Fulfill the Promise of Good Capital
Crypto promised us independent capital which makes the future arrive faster.
That capital now belongs to banks, ETFs, and hedge funds.
The tech of blockchains is soon to be old news.

3. By Being Fiercely Independent
We can do the right choices because we don't owe anything to anyone.
- Government: every coin was mined and no money ever raised.
- VCs: silly rabbit, tricks are for kids.
- Foundation: no need for theater.
- Crypto: we don't play your toxic games.

5. To Produce the Best Possible Open Asset
Singularly focused on what an open, perpetual, and meaningful asset means.
Technology decays, but content is forever.
Think LIBRA, not blockchain.

4. Using Modern Tools
We've been running experimental Diem and Move networks since 2019.
Our blockchain has every smart contract you need to use LIBRA, minus the garbage.
Committed to whatever technology helps our people to save and plan for the future.

6. With Plans Measured in Centuries
We plan always be a part of the future, whatever it may bring.
Communities with evergreen endowments to create interventions in society.
