1. Yes, We Took It
We hard-forked Facebook¹ out of Libra.

2. To Fulfill the Promise of Good Capital
Crypto promised us independent capital which makes the future arrive faster.
That capital now belongs to banks, ETFs, and hedge funds.
The tech of blockchains is soon to be old news.

3. By Being Fiercely Independent
We make the right choices because we don't owe anything to anyone.
- Government: every coin was mined and no money ever raised.
- Foundation: moral authority over formal mediocracy.
- Crypto industry: there's far less than meets the eye.
- VCs: we are the thing that replaces you.

4. To Produce the Best Possible Open Asset
Singularly focused on an open, perpetual, and meaningful asset.
Evergreen endowments that create interventions in society.

5. Using Modern Tools
We've been running experimental Diem and Move networks since 2019.
Our blockchain has every smart contract you need to use LIBRA, minus the garbage.
LIBRA, not blockchain: committed to whatever technology helps our people to save and plan for the future.

6. With Plans Measured in Centuries
We plan to always be a part of the future, whatever it may bring.
With your LIBRA handed off to the next generation.
No rush, and infinite possibilities.
