1. Yes, We Took It

We hard-forked Facebook¹ out of Libra.

2. To Fulfill the Promise of Good Capital

Crypto promised us spiritually elevated capital which could make the future
arrive faster.
- Said capital now belongs to banks, ETFs, and hedge funds.
- And tech of blockchains will soon be in the rear-view mirror.

4. Producing the Best Open Asset

- Singularly focused on an open, perpetual, and meaningful digital property.
- Without financial nihilism, pyramid schemes, obfuscation and confusion.
- Just people planning and saving for interventions in society.

3. Being Fiercely Independent

We make the right choices because we don't owe anything to anyone.
- Government proof: every coin was mined and no money ever raised.
- Foundation free: moral authority over formal mediocracy.
- So long Crypto industry: there's far less than meets the eye.
- No thanks VCs: this is the thing that one day replaces you.

5. Using Modern Tools

- We've been running experimental Diem and Move networks since 2019.
- Our blockchain has every smart contract you need to use LIBRA, minus the garbage.
- Committed to whatever technology helps our people to save and plan for the
future.
- LIBRA, not blockchain

6. With Plans Measured in Centuries

- We plan to always be a part of the future, whatever it may bring.
- With your LIBRA handed off to the next generation.
- No rush, and infinite possibilities.

7. To Become a Force of Society
