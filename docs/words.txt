INDEPENDENT CAPITAL
------------------------------------------------------
1. Yes, We Took It
We hard-forked Facebook¹ out of Libra.

2. To Fulfill the Promise of Good Capital
Crypto promised us independent capital which makes the future arrive faster.
That capital now belongs to banks, ETFs, and hedge funds.
The tech of blockchains is soon to be old news.

3. By Being Fiercely Independent
We can do the right things because we don't owe anything to anyone.
- Government: every coin was mined and no money ever raised.
- VCs: LOL you're all so silly.
- Foundation: no need for theater.
- Crypto bros: we don't play your toxic games.

4. Using Modern Tools
Programmable capital needs a cutting edge chain.
We've been running experimental Diem and Move networks since 2019.
Our blockchain has every smart contract you need to use LIBRA, minus the garbage.

5. To Produce the Best Open Asset
Singularly focused on what an open, perpetual, and meaningful asset means.
Technology decays, but content is forever.
Think LIBRA, not blockchain.


6. With Plans Measured in Centuries
We built tools for people to save and plan for the future.
Communities with evergreen endowments to create interventions in society.
We plan always be a part of the future, whatever it may bring.
