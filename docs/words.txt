AN ENDOWMENT FOR GOOD AND PROFIT

1. Yes, We Took It
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Many years ago we hard-forked FacebookÂ¹ out of DiemÂ².

2. To Fulfill the Promise of Good Capital
--------------------------------------------------------------------

We were originally attracted to blockchain for the promise of independent capital which would make the future arrive faster.

But crypto currencies are silly. And crypto now belongs to banks, ETFs, and hedge funds. Worse, the technology itself is in the rear-view mirror.

However, something meaningful is still possible with openly accessible, perpetually durable, hyper-liquid, high-leverage, rent-producing digital titles.


3. By Producing a Sensible Asset
--------------------------------------------------------------------

$CARPE is an asset designed for one purpose: perpetual capital for good and profit.

Prosperity comes from people saving and planning for transformation.

Here at Carpe over the years our peer-to-peer games have made users save, pledge, defer, or donate nearly 90%+ of their earnings to future-looking programs. Programs seeking good and profit.

4. Which is Fiercely Independent
--------------------------------------------------------------------

We make correct choices because we don't owe anything to anyone.

*Government proof*
Every coin was mined and no money ever raised.

*No legal entity*
Yes to moral authority, meritocracy, and showing up everyday.

*Proof of Labor*
No ponzinomics; let's play games the world wants to play.

*Standalone tech*
We won't be hostage to the political economy of ill-conceived smart contract platforms.

*Hard pass, VCs*
We have no rush, and infinite possibilities.

5. Uses Modern Tools
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Having our own Layer-1 blockchain ensures $CARPE's independence.

We've been developing and running high performance Diem and Move blockchains platforms since 2019. The chain is meant to have all the smart contracts any person or institution would need to use, save, plan with $CARPE. It actively excludes any nonsense to distract us. Think $CARPE, not Blockchain.

6. And Has Plans Measured in Centuries
--------------------------------------------------------------------

We play a long game that few have patience for.

On the other side of the desert exists dependable capital for interventions in society, for all future generations. âœŠðŸŒž
