1. Yes, We Took It
-----------------------------------------------------

Many years ago we hard-forked FacebookÂ¹ out of DiemÂ².

2. To Fulfill the Promise of Good Capital
-----------------------------------------------------

We came to blockchain for independent capital which would make the future arrive faster.

Now crypto belongs to banks, ETFs, and hedge funds. And the technology itself is in the rear-view mirror.

Perpetually durable, hyper-liquid, high-leverage capital is an endowment to society, if it is designed that way.

3. By Producing a Sensible Asset
-----------------------------------------------------

$CARPE is an accessible and perpetual digital property. It is carefully designed for its purpose: capital.

Prosperity comes from people saving and planning for transformation.

Over the years our peer-to-peer games made users save, pledge, defer, or donate nearly 90%+ of their earnings to future programs, for good and profit.

4. Which is Fiercely Independent
-----------------------------------------------------

We make correct choices because we don't owe anything to anyone.
- Standalone Tech: we don't depend on ideas of other infrastructure providers.
- Government proof: every coin was mined and no money ever raised.
- No Labs or Foundation: yes to moral authority and meritocracy.
- So long, Crypto industry: we'll play games the world wants to play.
- No thanks VCs: we have no rush, and infinite possibilities.

5. Uses Modern Tools
-----------------------------------------------------

Having our own Layer-1 blockchain ensures $CARPE's independence. It's not easy, but it ensures our perpetuity.

We've been running high performance Diem and Move networks since 2019. The chain is meant to have all the smart contracts any person or institution need to use, save, plan with $CARPE, but none of the nonsense to distract us.

Think $CARPE, not Blockchain.

6. And Has Plans Measured in Centuries
-----------------------------------------------------

We play a long game that few have patience for.

On the other side of the desert exists dependable capital for interventions in society, for all future generations.
