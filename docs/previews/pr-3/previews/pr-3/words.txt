GOOD CAPITAL

1. Yes, We Took It
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Many years ago we hard-forked FacebookÂ¹ out of Libra.

2. To Realize the Promise of Good Capital
--------------------------------------------------------------------

We came to blockchain drawn by its early ideal, that capital could be unbounded: independent, accelerating, transformative.

Letâ€™s be real. Much of crypto has turned inward, chasing novelty or nostalgia. The more sophisticated projects seek absorption into legacy financeâ€”banking rails, ETF wrappers, asset desksâ€”while while the public watches in confusion.

And yet, something remarkable may have been uncovered along the way.

What if these early systems were simply scaffolding for something more enduring? We stand here to propose exactly that: an open, liquid, lasting, high-leverage architecture for titlesâ€”of value, of intent, of shared consequence.

3. Rooted in a Principled Asset
--------------------------------------------------------------------
$LBR exists for a singular reason: to seed perpetual capital in service of both good and gain.

Prosperity does not arise from chance. It emerges from restraint, from design, from saving toward a vision not yet realized.

Through Open Libraâ€™s peer-to-peer experiments, participants have pledged, deferred, and redirected more than 90% of their earnings into forward-facing programsâ€”initiatives that are both idealistic and economically sound.


4. And Stubbornly Independent
--------------------------------------------------------------------
We choose freely because we owe no one.

* Technically Sovereign *
We are not beholden to smart contract platforms designed with different goals. Our stack is our own, built to last.

* Proof of Labor *
There is no shell game, no empty cycle of promises. Only systems people want to useâ€”again and again.

* Without Investors *
We have no exit to race toward. No quarterly metrics to chase. Our horizon is unhurried and vast.

* Untouched by Government *
Every $LBR was earned through mining. No pre-mine, no sale, no regulatory arbitrage.

* No Legal Wrapper *
We work without incorporationâ€”not out of neglect, but principle. Authority here is moral. Leadership is earned. Presence matters more than paperwork.

* No Predators*
We do not endorse capital games disguised as consensusâ€”schemes where early insiders earn endlessly while latecomers subsidize their position. 

5. Grounded in Modern Tools
--------------------------------------------------------------------
A purpose-built Layer-1 blockchain secures the independence of $LBR.

Since 2019, weâ€™ve worked in the Move and Diem ecosystemsâ€”quietly, consistently, building performance-grade infrastructure.

The result is a chain that supports contracts and coordination for anyoneâ€”individual or institutionâ€”wishing to store, grow, or distribute capital with intent.

We leave behind distractions and empty noise. Think less about blockchain. Think more about what it enables.

6. And Measured in Centuries
--------------------------------------------------------------------
 
We are building across time with no end in sight. Not quarters or hype cycles, but generations.

Beyond the marketâ€™s churn, there lies a calm reserve: capital designed for interventions that matter â€” for institutions not yet imagined, and citizens not yet born.

We have the patience to build something lasting âœŠðŸŒž
